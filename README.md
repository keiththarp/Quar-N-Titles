# Quar'N'Titles

<a href="https://keiththarp.github.io/Quar-N-Titles/">View deployed app.</a>

As a part of the Quar'N'Titles development team I worked across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript focussed on the frontend design and functionality of the app.

Designed to help users keep track of movies, tv shows, and books they've consumed during COVID-19.

When a title is searched, the title and relevant information will be displayed for the user, who can then decide to add 
it to their list.

This application uses a single HTML page and a single JS file, with most elements being created dynamically. Our css is powered by a modified version of Tailwind. Our back-end is powered by Jquery and uses the following API's to retrieve information:

- OMDB - Movie Database
- TMDB - Television Database
- OpenLibrary- Books Database

The titles are stored in local storage so they will remain saved on the users device unless they would like to remove it.
